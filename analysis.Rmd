In /t/-medial position, vowels of higher-frequency words have a lower CQ than low frequency at the offset. In terms of termporal unfolding from 50% of the duration, vowels in high-frequency words have decreasing CQ (from more to less constricted), while vowels in low-frequency have increasing CQ (from less to more constricted).

In /t/-final position, vowels of any frequency have decreasing CQ along their duration. The CQ starts decreasing earlier in vowels of high-frequency words than in low-frequency words.

CQ is in genaral lower in /t/-final position than in /t/-medial (towards the end), so that vowels in /t/-final position have less constricted folds.

)
```

In /k/-medial position, vowels at their offset have a higher CQ in higher-frequency than in low-frequency words. In terms of of termporal unfolding, the CQ decreases along vowel duration (decreasing fold constriction), but in low-frequency words it decreases earlier than in high-frequency words.

In /k/-final position, vowels at their offset have a slightly higher CQ in higher-frequency than in low-frequency words. In terms of of termporal unfolding from 50% of vowel duration, the CQ decreases at a faster rate in low frequency words than in high frequency words.

CQ is in genaral lower in /k/-final position than in /k/-medial, so that vowels in /k/-final position have less constricted folds.
